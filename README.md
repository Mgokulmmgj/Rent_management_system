It enables administrators to manage tenants, rental units, rent payments, and occupancy details efficiently through a centralized dashboard. Built using Node.js for backend services, MySQL for database management, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, the system improves data accuracy, reduces manual effort, and enhances overall administrative productivity.
